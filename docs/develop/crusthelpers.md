[Crust](https://crust.network) provides a decentralized storage network for Web3. It is designed to realize core values of decentralization, privacy and assurance. Crust supports multiple storage-layer protocols such as IPFS and exposes instant accessible on-chain storage functions to users.

The Crust protocol is 100% compatible with the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) protocol, and it matches people who have hard drive space to spare with those who need to store data or host content. Crust supports most contract platforms, such as Polygon/Solana/NEAR/etc. with its cross-chain solution.

> To learn more about Crust, check its [Decentralized Storage market](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/DSM) and [Cross-chain Storage Solution](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildCrossChainSolution#ii-native-ipfs-integration). Also, you can start building with [Crust Build-101](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/build101)

## Crust Storage Helpers

- [Crust Files](https://crustfiles.io): the 1st web3 personal cloud storage build by Crust community, supports multi-web3 wallet login and provide fully decentralized and privacy storage function for all web3 users.
- [IPFS W3Auth Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#authenticated-gateways): Web3 authenticated IPFS gateway, support all the IPFS *WRITE* functions, that helps users upload file or host content after pass the web3 auth verification.
- [IPFS W3Auth Pinning Service](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSW3AuthPin): A standard IPFS pinning service with web3 authentication, it allows users access Crust storage resources without interacting with Crust blockchain.
- [Crust Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/crust-ipfs-pin): A standard github action which can involve the fully decentralized hosting CI/CD with Crust.
